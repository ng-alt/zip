Betas are works in progress.  When a beta has a seemingly stable set
of features we may post a public beta so developers can see where the
code is going and make contributions or comment.  This package contains
public betas.

A Release Candidate is a beta that is believed to have the full feature
set that will be released.  It's still being tested, and things can
still change, but we thought it close when we posted it.

We make no guarantees as to the state of these betas so use at your own
risk.  The Info-ZIP license applies to all postings, including betas.
