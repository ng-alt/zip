Zip 3.0

We have posted Zip 3.0, June 5th 2008.  This is a major upgrade
from Zip 2.32, the current Zip 2.x release.  A quick summary of
features is below, but see the file WhatsNew for the detailed list
of major features and upgrades as well as what's on the list for
Zip 3.1.  Send in your feature suggestions and bug reports.

Quick list of major changes in Zip 3.0:

- Support for files and archives greater than 2 GB using large file I/O
  and the Zip64 extensions.  Also can now have more than 64K entries in
  an archive.

- Zip now can create and update split archives.  Split archives are
  normal archives split into a set of files that can then be stored on
  removable media for instance.  There's also a split pause mode that
  tells Zip to pause after each split to allow writing splits directly
  to removable media and changing the media between splits.

- Unicode extensions are supported.  If Unicode support is enabled
  and supported on the system Zip is run on, Zip now can read all
  paths, including paths not supported in the current character
  set, and store those paths in portable UTF-8 format.  These
  Unicode paths can then be used to partially or fully recreate
  the paths on other systems depending on the Unicode support provided
  by the unzip on the receiving system.  In particular, this allows
  portability of paths between Windows and Unix.  Unicode comments
  are also supported for entries, but only on systems where UTF-8
  is the current character set.  Unicode comment support for other
  systems is expected in Zip 3.1.

- A new command line parser is implemented.  This new parser allows
  for command line permuting, where options can appear anywhere on
  the command line that an argument is not reserved as part of another
  option or value list, and allows adding options to the end of the
  command line, for instance.  It supports long options, allowing for
  more readable command lines.  It allows lists for the -x and -i
  exclude and include options to now appear anywhere in the command
  line.  And some bugs in command line processing in Zip 2.32 have
  been fixed.

- Additional archive modes have been added, including a difference
  mode for supporting incremental backups, a file sync mode for
  synchronizing an existing archive with the current file system
  (which can be much faster than creating a new archive), and a
  copy mode that allows copying entries from one archive to another.

- Now can add bzip2 compression as a compression option in Zip.  bzip2
  compression can result in much more compact entries in some cases,
  but the user should verify that bzip2 is supported on the target
  unzip before using this new compression choice.

- The Windows dll has been updated to support the new Zip64 large
  file and larger number of entries limits.  This new dll is not
  backward compatible with the Zip 2.32 dll, as the arguments to
  the dll support the added capabilities, but modifying existing
  programs to use the new dll should be simple.  See the included
  Visual Basic example project for details.

- Zip now has better support of streaming and piping.

- Zip can now output progress information, such as how many entries
  have been processed, how many bytes have been processed, and more
  useful progress dots.  Zip can also now generate log files.

- The archive fixing capability is slightly improved, and now can
  fix split archives.

- The Windows archive bit is now supported, though the new difference
  mode is probably more reliable than relying on the Windows archive
  bit for creating incremental backups.

- Zip can list the files that would be added to an archive.

- A new extended help option lists a very terse summary of the major
  features of Zip and how to use them.

- Many bug fixes.

As always, see the Zip manual page for details on what Zip has and
how to use all features.

Enjoy!
